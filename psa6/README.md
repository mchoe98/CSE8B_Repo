Testing Description:
The only file I worked on for this assignment specifically was Gui2048.java.
This file is supposed to display the 2048 game to the player, so to test
this file I just tried playing the 2048 game from this file. If the game
did not show me the correct behavior, I knew my file had a problem. To
remedy my file's problems, I would match the incorrect behavior with
the part of my file responsible for handling this behavior. Once this
portion of the file was located, I would refer to piazza, the book, and 
other class resources to remedy the issues if the issues were not readily
apparent. On the other hand, if the game showed me the correct behavior, I
knew my program was working properly.

Short Response:
Unix/Linux Questions:
1. To perform this simply input "mkdir -p fooDir/barDir".
2. An example of a wildcard character use would be removing all
.class files. To do this, I would use the wildcard * before .class and 
after "rm ".
3. To open all Java source code files in the current directory simply
input * after "vim -p".

Java Question:
4. The keyword "static" means that a method cannot access its calling
object. Static methods can instead use their class. An example of a 
static method would be a method that never needs to access its calling
object.
5. Instead of creating all these different methods for different colored
circles, this student can create just one drawCircle() method with an
additional Color parameter. This method would be the same as all these
other methods except that it would use the color from the parameter to
color the circle.
